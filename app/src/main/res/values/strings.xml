    <string name="NGO2_info">The Akshaya Patra Foundation is an independent charitable trust registered under the Indian Trusts Act 1882 (Reg. No. 154). We endeavour to implement the Government of India’s PM POSHAN Initiative (formerly the Mid-Day Meal Scheme) to solve at scale the overarching societal issues of classroom hunger and malnutrition in the country.

        It is our firm belief that investing in child nutrition and education is one of the most effective entry points for human development. Driven by this belief, we strive to provide children with a hot, nutritious and tasty mid-day meal every school day as an incentive to come to school. Thus, the vision – ‘No child in India shall be deprived of education because of hunger.’

        Since the year 2000, we have endeavoured to reach out to children with wholesome mid-day meals every school day by leveraging technology and effectively harnessing the potential of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. By establishing an extensive network of kitchens and partnering with the Government of India, state governments, UT administrations, corporate houses and philanthropists, we have created a system to address a social cause on a massive scale. Our efforts are in direct alignment with two critical Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 2 – Zero Hunger and SDG 4 – Quality Education.

        Currently, we serve over 2 million children studying in 24,082 government and government-aided schools and Anganwadi centres across 72 locations in 16 states and 2 union teritories</string>

    <!--    <string name="NGO3_info">Saath India foundation started in 2021 with an aim to provide shelter to poor children and elderly of rural areas. The NGO is founded and situated in Village Mauhli, Mirzapur (UP) and have set up a shelter of area 10,000 sq feets, solely dedicated for taking care of needy children and elderly. It aims to serve elder needs in a holistic manner, enabling them to live active, dignified and healthier lives.In a country of 104 million elders, 51 million lives are below the poverty line. By 2050 the number of senior citizens is estimated to rise to 324 million. With more than half the country's elderly living below the poverty line, even day to day survival is crucial. With this increasing burden, COVID-19 has resulted in an increasing poverty rate in India, affecting millions living in the country. To combat this situation, the foundation has setup its offices within the village with the support of gram panchayats. It aims to hear and reach out to the needy people of the village and help them in every possible way. The foundation aims to track senior citizens who are not supported by their families and who have worked hard all their lives but did not have any pension facility, and provide monetary support to them. For poor children, Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Hence the foundation aims to impart education through its vocational programs to those who can't afford it. The foundation has also started to sponsor group weddings, within the village, for the parents who can't afford to organise weddings on their own for their adult son/daughter. The main of the Saath India foundation is to reach out and help more rural areas of India. In the near future we are planning to build a retirement homes for the elderly people who are alone, face health problems, depression and loneliness. We thrives to builds upon innovative pilot projects and strategic partnerships to extend a helping hand and to protect the rights of India’s needy and provide relief to them through various interventions.What we want to mention is your little harmless help (in the form of money or free service) can brighten their autumn </string>-->

    <string name="NGO4_info">Annamrita Foundation is a non-profit, non-religious, non-sectarian charitable trust set up with the purpose of serving mid-day meals to school kids across India. Formerly known as ISKCON Food Relief Foundation, Annamrita Foundation is the largest Mid Day Meal provider in Maharashtra.

Midday Meal is a strategic program to liberate the underprivileged children from scourge of malnutrition and illiteracy. This program is a project of the Government of India, and is being implemented by by Annamrita in select schools in Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana and West Bengal.
Since the launch in 2004, we have set up state-of-the-art kitchens in 7 states. Our kitchens are ISO 22000:2005 certified. As of now, we serve nearly 12 lakhs meals daily to underprivileged children from our various centers across India. Most of these children come from slums and tribal areas. The purpose of implementing this scheme is to facilitate the Government in increasing the enrollment in these schools, reducing the dropout rate and improving the attendance. Also as these are the formative years for the future adult, nutrition is of prime importance.

Today it takes just Rs 450 for an ENTIRE YEAR. ie. just Rs 2 per day per child. We request individuals, corporates, businesses etc. to come forward and help us sustain and further our cause.</string>
